# Nicholas Altieri - Web Developer

## Welcome to My Portfolio

My name is Nick, an aspiring web developer from New York. This portfolio showcases many of the skills and technologies I have learned over the course of my studies. My projects emphasise the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to produce well designed and functional web applications.

### <a href="https://nicholasaltieri.github.io/Bus-Tracker/"> Bus Tracker Maps API </a>

In this project, I used the MapBox API to display a real time navigation map on the document object module. With the use of JavaScript we were able to use markers which display a certain point on the map in latitude and longitude. The map features use these markers to display bus stop between MIT and Harvard. When the button is clicked, an array or latitude and longitude points are passed through a function to show the different stops.

### <a href="https://nicholasaltieri.github.io/Eyes-Exercise/"> Eyes Exercise </a>

This exercise emphasizes using JavaScript to manipulate the document object module and its elements. It also touches on css styling principles. The 'eyes' in this file consist of a pair of divs styled to represent a pair of eyes. We used JavaScript mouse events to program the eyes to follow the mouse in the DOM.

### <a href="https://nicholasaltieri.github.io/Pacman/"> Pacman Factory</a>

This exercise creates a factory which outputs 'Pacmen' onto the document object module. Every time the create pacman button is clicked, another pacman is created on the page at a random position. The start game button initializes an action where all the pacment on the page will move to the edge of the DOM and then their direction will reverse. Clicking the start game button will cuase the pacmen to move faster.
